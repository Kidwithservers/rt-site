            <h1><span>About</span>Us</h1>
            <P>
                At OWLink, we are a team of dedicated, forward thinking innovators
                and telecoms nerds, passionate about telecommunications industry, 
                and our customers, committed to building top-shelf, standards compliant 
                products and services, that respect the intelligence and common sense of our end-users.
                <br>
                Unlike many other providers, we are deeply committed being good citizens
                of the telecoms community, and strive for over-and-above regulatory compliance
                and abuse prevention. We implement STIR/SHAKEN robocall mitigation, in addition
                to next-generation internal statistical algorithms to detect and prevent network
                abuse by robocallers and scammers. We are also go above and beyond to support
                all registered carrier requirements, from standard 499/USF requirements to
                those requirements typically reserved for ILECs exclusively, such as LD equal access.
                <br>
                We are a full-facilities based CLEC, with direct
                control over all of our own numbering resources, in addition to a direct
                connection with the NPAC, which means that we are in total control of our
                numbering resources, ensuring accurate completion of port-in and out requests,
                in addition to the ability to assign as many contiguous numbers as needed.
                <br>
                We also custom-build all of our telephone switches, rather than simply reselling
                service from another carrier, or using a standard, off-the-shelf switching platform.
                Because of this, we are able to offer advanced telephone features, and fully control
                the flow of calls through our network. This custom switch implements a unique
                routing structure, enabling our unique unified communications products.
                <br>
                Because we control both our own numbers and our own switches, we are able to
                directly control our own routing, with direct local interconnection agreements
                and direct agreements with FG-D tandem providers. We build LERG entries for
                all of our number blocks and LRNs with our own CLLIs. We don't rely on one of
                the big two intermediary companies, but instead rely on our own infrastructure
                as much as possible, and use a diverse network of reputable, tier-one providers
                to ensure maximal uptime.
                <br>
                Finally, we take an active role in the telecoms regulatory space, contributing
                to FCC and state PUC requests for comment, rulemaking proceedings and hearings.
                We are also actively working on pushing forward the state of telecommunications
                regulations in the US. From pushing for better regulations on robocalling to
                standardizing SIP over IP interconnection for local interconnects, we pride
                ourselves for being on the forefront of the regulatory landscape.
                <br>
                Put together, we're a technologically innovative company, on the cutting-edge
                of the telecommunications landscape,
