            <h2>Why OWLink?</h2>
            <p>
                We know the telecommunications space is highly competitive,
                and that you likely have dozens of providers to choose from.
                So, why use us? There's one clear reason: We Care. Our passion
                for the industry and serving our customers is visible in everything
                we do. 
                
                It's why unlike almost all other carriers (including some
                of the biggest names in the industry) we're full Local Exchange
                Carriers, with our own direct connections to the PSTN. We aren't
                an IP-only carrier relying on another company to host our numbers,
                and we aren't an unregulated, fly-by-night reseller, simply billing
                for access to other carrier's resources.

                It's why we don't sell unsustainable, misleading "only taxes and fees"
                plans, hide the cost of service with hardware, and why we don't hide fees
                from users until after purchase.
