                <h3>Robocop advanced robocall mitigation</h3>
                <p>
                    All of our services include our Robocop anti-robocalling system. Robocop
                    combines aggregated robocall data from tens of thousands of specially seeded
                    trap numbers, complaints from real customers, network and signalling data, and
                    realtime, interactive screening to deliver a highly effective and minimally intrusive
                    screening experience. Even better than this, Robocop is adaptive, learning from
                    every call it receives to automatically whitelist your contacts. In less than a
                    week, Robocop will be able to block 99% of inbound robocalls, without annoying
                    and intrusive voice prompts for every caller.

            <h2>Why OWLink?</h2>
            <p>
                We know the telecommunications space is highly competitive,
                and that you likely have dozens of providers to choose from.
                So, why use us? There's one clear reason: We Care. Our passion
                for the industry and serving our customers is visible in everything
                we do. 
                <br><br>
                It's why unlike almost all other carriers (including some
                of the biggest names in the industry) we're full Local Exchange
                Carriers, with our own direct connections to the PSTN. We aren't
                an IP-only carrier relying on another company to host our numbers,
                and we aren't an unregulated, fly-by-night reseller, simply billing
                for access to other carrier's resources.
                <br><br>
                It's why we don't charge misleading and superfluous fees and surcharges,
                or offer misleading "taxes and fees" plans, which camouflage the real cost
                of the service in nebulous "subscriber line charge" fees.
                <br><br>
                It's why we are committed to ongoing innovation in the telecoms space,
                innovating new features and services for our customers, helping to move
                the telecommunications industry into the 21st century.
